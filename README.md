# SoftSheep

This repository contains the marketing site for **SoftSheep**, the minimalist,
macOS-focused studio founded by Tiberon Kuiper. The site is designed with a
calm, premium aesthetic inspired by Apple, Vercel, and MacPaw.

## Getting started

The site is a static build that can be served locally with any HTTP server.

```bash
npm install --global serve # or use python -m http.server
serve .
```

Then visit <http://localhost:3000> (or the port reported by your server).

## Deployment

The site is optimized for GitHub Pages (GitHub.io). Commit the `index.html`,
`styles/`, and `scripts/` directories to publish updates.
